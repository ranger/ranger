# Contributing to Ranger

## Tips for bug reports

* Was this issue already reported?  Please do a quick search.
* Maybe the problem is solved in the current master branch already?
  Simply clone ranger with `git clone https://github.com/ranger/ranger` or
  download the git version via https://github.com/ranger/ranger/archive/master.zip
  and run `./ranger.py` directly to find out.
* You can obtain much better error messages with `ranger --debug`, please post
  those in bug reports rather than the usual, single-line error message. Also
  check the log by using the default map `W` or by running the command `display_log`.
* Send security-relevant bugs PGP-encrypted to hut@hut.pm, see `HACKING.md`.

## Tips on patching

* See `HACKING.md`

Thank you!
