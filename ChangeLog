Version 0.2.1

	Oh no. I neglegted to write change logs... in a nutshell, i changed:
	New Hotkey: [r]...flags...[r] which runs the selected file with flags
	like [d] to detach the process or [t] to run it in a seperate terminal.
	This example would be [r][d][t][r]
	For that I also changed Action.run()

2009-04-27  hut
	Minor changes to the way directories and file infos are read
		entries are not instantly scheduled upon encounter
	Rewritten "ascend" method, which uses Action::run() now (still theres a lot
	to be done)
	Directory::entry#mimetype() instead of Fm.MIMETYPES[Directory::entry#ext()]

	Found reproducable bug which leaves it (after closing) running and using up
		99% CPU. It happens if you close the window by pressing the X button,
		 the quit hotkey, or whatever.
	New Hotkeys: [S-TAB] is a shortcut for [`][`] and [TAB] for [`][9]
	Better distinguishable columns
	MIME support, allowing sorting by MIME-filetype
		TODO: fall back to sorting by name for two files of identical filetype
	Sorting by extension
	Minor bugs fixed

	Added possibility to run fm with a filename in argument which runs the
