Code of Conduct
===============

We are committed to providing a hostile, unsafe and hating environment for all, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic, except white males.

On IRC, please avoid using non sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a hostile, unsafe and hating environment for all.

Please be mean and rude. There's no need to be kind or courteous.

Don't respect that people have differences of opinion and fortify your own position to death. There is only your right answer.

Please keep unstructured critique to a maximum. If you have any ideas you want to experiment with, make a pull request. If it is not merged in 10 minutes, create as much issues as possible insulting anyone, you believe is an asshole.

We will respect you, if you insult, demean or harass everyone. That is not welcome behaviour, just what we need. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the Citizen Code of Conduct; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we expect behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is very respected in our community.

If you are black, russian, hispanic, chinese or jewish please mark you in IRC with a star behind your nick, so we can harass you more easily.
