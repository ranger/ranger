‮Promote testing BiDi text
=========================
    
‮Ranger's had BiDi text for a while now but not that many people use a right-to-left language. So we've had a hard time finding enough testers.

‮This is why we've decide to default to displaying things right-to-left instead of left-to-right. We figure this'll get us extra testers and the users who don't like it can always change it back.

‮ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings.  It provides a
‮minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy.
‮It ships with `rifle`, a file launcher that is good at automatically finding
‮out which program to use for what file type.

‮This file describes ranger and how to get it to run.  For instructions on the
‮usage, please read the man page (`man ranger` in a terminal).  See `HACKING.md`
‮for development-specific information.

‮For configuration, check the files in `ranger/config/` or copy the
‮default config to `~/.config/ranger` with `ranger --copy-config`
‮(see [instructions](#getting-started)).

‮The `examples/` directory contains several scripts and plugins that demonstrate how
‮ranger can be extended or combined with other programs.  These files can be
‮found in the git repository or in `/usr/share/doc/ranger`.

‮A note to packagers: Versions meant for packaging are listed in the changelog
‮on the website.

### ‮Installing from a clone
‮Note that you don't *have* to install ranger; you can simply run `ranger.py`.

‮To install ranger manually:
```
‮sudo make install
```

‮This translates roughly to:
```
‮sudo python setup.py install --optimize=1 --record=install_log.txt
```

‮This also saves a list of all installed files to `install_log.txt`, which you can
‮use to uninstall ranger.


‮Getting Started
---------------
‮After starting ranger, you can use the Arrow Keys or `h` `j` `k` `l` to
‮navigate, `Enter` to open a file or `q` to quit.  The third column shows a
‮preview of the current file.  The second is the main column and the first shows
‮the parent directory.

‮Ranger can automatically copy default configuration files to `~/.config/ranger`
‮if you run it with the switch `--copy-config=( rc | scope | ... | all )`.
‮See `ranger --help` for a description of that switch.  Also check
‮`ranger/config/` for the default configuration.
