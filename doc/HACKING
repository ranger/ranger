Guidelines on Code Modification
===============================

Coding Style
------------

* Use syntax compatible to both python 2.6 and 3.1.
* Use docstrings with pydoc in mind
* Follow the style guide for python code:
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* Test the code with "doctest" where it makes sense


Patches
-------

Send patches, created with "git format-patch", to the email adress

    hut@lavabit.com

If you plan to do major changes, or many changes over time, I encourage
you to create a fork on GitHub, Gitorious or any other site.


Starting Points
---------------

Good places to read about ranger internals are:
ranger/core/actions.py
ranger/container/fsobject.py

About the UI:
ranger/gui/widgets/browsercolumn.py
ranger/gui/widgets/browserview.py
ranger/gui/ui.py


Common Changes
--------------

* Change which files are previewed in the auto preview:
In ranger/container/file.py
the constant PREVIEW_BLACKLIST

* Adding options:
In ranger/config/rc.conf
add the default value, like: my_option = True
In ranger/container/settings.py
add the name of your option to the constant ALLOWED_SETTINGS

The setting is now accessible at self.settings.my_option,
assuming <self> is a "SettingsAware" object.

* Adding colorschemes:
Copy ranger/colorschemes/default.py to ranger/colorschemes/myscheme.py
and modify it according to your needs.  Alternatively, mimic the jungle
colorscheme.  It subclasses the default scheme and just modifies a few things.
In ranger/config/rc.conf (or ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf), add the line:

    set colorscheme myscheme

* Change the file type => application associations:
Edit the configuration file ~/.config/ranger/rifle.conf.  The default one can
be obtained by running "ranger --copy-config rifle".

* Change the file extension => mime type associations:
Modify ranger/data/mime.types


Version Numbering
-----------------

Three numbers;  The first changes on a rewrite, the second changes when major
configuration incompatibilities occur and the third changes with each release.
