ranger is a console file manager with \s-1VI\s0 key bindings.
.SH "RESOURCES"
.IX Header "RESOURCES"
This \fImanual\fR contains instructions on how to use and configure ranger.
.PP
Inside \fIranger\fR, you can press \fI?\fR for a list of key bindings, commands or
settings.
.PP
The \fI\s-1README\s0\fR contains install instructions.
.PP
The file \fI\s-1HACKING\s0.md\fR contains guidelines for code modification.
.PP
The directory \fIdoc/configs\fR contains configuration files.  They are usually
installed to \fI/usr/share/doc/ranger/config\fR and can be obtained with ranger's
\&\-\-copy\-config option.
.PP
The directory \fIexamples\fR contains reference implementations for ranger
plugins, sample configuration files and some programs for integrating ranger
with other software.  They are usually installed to
\&\fI/usr/share/doc/ranger/examples\fR.
.PP
The man page of \fBrifle\fR\|(1) describes the functions of the file opener
.PP
The section \fI\s-1LINKS\s0\fR of this man page contains further resources.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.IP "\fIpath ...\fR" 14
.IX Item "path ..."
Each path will be opened in a tab and if the path is a file it will be selected.
Omitting this is equivalent to providing the current directory.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR" 14
.IX Item "-d, --debug"
Activate the debug mode: Whenever an error occurs, ranger will exit and print a
full traceback.  The default behavior is to merely print the name of the
exception in the statusbar/log and try to keep running.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR" 14
.IX Item "-c, --clean"
Activate the clean mode:  ranger will not access or create any configuration
files nor will it leave any traces on your system.  This is useful when your
configuration is broken, when you want to avoid clutter, etc.
.IP "\fB\-\-cachedir\fR=\fIdir\fR" 14
.IX Item "--cachedir=dir"
Change the cache directory of ranger from \f(CW$XDG_CACHE_HOME\fR or ~/.cache/ranger to \*(L"dir\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-r\fR \fIdir\fR, \fB\-\-confdir\fR=\fIdir\fR" 14
.IX Item "-r dir, --confdir=dir"
Change the configuration directory of ranger from \f(CW$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR or ~/.config/ranger to \*(L"dir\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-\-datadir\fR=\fIdir\fR" 14
.IX Item "--datadir=dir"
Change the data directory of ranger from \f(CW$XDG_DATA_HOME\fR or ~/.local/share/ranger to \*(L"dir\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-\-copy\-config\fR=\fIfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--copy-config=file"
Create copies of the default configuration files in your local configuration
directory.  Existing ones will not be overwritten.  Possible values: \fIall\fR,
\&\fIcommands\fR, \fIcommands_full\fR, \fIrc\fR, \fIrifle\fR, \fIscope\fR.
.Sp
Note: You may want to disable loading of the global configuration files by
exporting \fIRANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC=FALSE\fR in your environment.  See also:
\&\fB\s-1FILES\s0\fR, \fB\s-1ENVIRONMENT\s0\fR
.Sp
\&\-\-copy\-config=\fBcommands\fR will copy only a small sample configuration file with
a thoroughly commented example.  It is recommended to keep this file tidy to
avoid getting defunct commands on ranger upgrades.  The full default
commands.py can be copied with \-\-copy\-config=\fBcommands_full\fR, but that file
will be ignored by ranger and serves only as a reference for making your own
commands.
.IP "\fB\-\-choosefile\fR=\fItargetfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--choosefile=targetfile"
Allows you to pick a file with ranger.  This changes the behavior so that when
you open a file, ranger will exit and write the absolute path of that file into
\&\fItargetfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-choosefiles\fR=\fItargetfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--choosefiles=targetfile"
Allows you to pick multiple files with ranger.  This changes the behavior so
that when you open a file, ranger will exit and write the absolute paths of all
selected files into \fItargetfile\fR, adding one newline after each filename.
.IP "\fB\-\-choosedir\fR=\fItargetfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--choosedir=targetfile"
Allows you to pick a directory with ranger.  When you exit ranger, it will
write the last visited directory into \fItargetfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-selectfile\fR=\fItargetfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--selectfile=targetfile"
Open ranger with \fItargetfile\fR selected. This is a legacy option, superseded by
the behavior for the \s-1POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS.\s0
.IP "\fB\-\-show\-only\-dirs\fR" 14
.IX Item "--show-only-dirs"
Display only the directories. May be used in conjunction with
\&\fB\-\-choosedir\fR=\fItargetfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-list\-unused\-keys\fR" 14
.IX Item "--list-unused-keys"
List common keys which are not bound to any action in the \*(L"browser\*(R" context.
This list is not complete, you can bind any key that is supported by curses:
use the key code returned by \f(CW\*(C`getch()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-list\-tagged\-files\fR=\fItag\fR" 14
.IX Item "--list-tagged-files=tag"
List all files which are tagged with the given tag.  Note: Tags are single
characters.  The default tag is \*(L"*\*(R"
.IP "\fB\-\-profile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--profile"
Print statistics of \s-1CPU\s0 usage on exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-cmd\fR=\fIcommand\fR" 14
.IX Item "--cmd=command"
Execute the command after the configuration has been read.  Use this option
multiple times to run multiple commands.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 14
.IX Item "--version"
Print the version and exit.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 14
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print a list of options and exit.
.SH "CONCEPTS"
.IX Header "CONCEPTS"
This part explains how certain parts of ranger work and how they can be used
efficiently.
.SS "\s-1TAGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "TAGS"
Tags are single characters which are displayed left of a filename.  You can use
tags however you want.  Press \*(L"t\*(R" to toggle tags and \*(L"ut\*(R" to remove any tags of
the selection. The default tag is an Asterisk (\*(L"*\*(R"), but you can use any tag by
typing \fI"<tagname>\fR.
.SS "\s-1PREVIEWS\s0"
.IX Subsection "PREVIEWS"
By default, only text files are previewed, but you can enable external preview
scripts by setting the option \f(CW\*(C`use_preview_script\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`preview_files\*(C'\fR to true.
.PP
This default script is \fI\f(CI%rangerdir\fI/data/scope.sh\fR. It contains more
documentation and calls to many external programs to generate previews. They
are automatically used when available but completely optional.

.PP
Install these programs (just the ones you need) and scope.sh will automatically
use them.
.PP
Independently of the preview script, there is a feature to preview images
by drawing them directly into the terminal. To enable this feature, set the
option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images\*(C'\fR to true and enable one of the image preview modes:
.PP
\fIiTerm2\fR
.IX Subsection "iTerm2"
.PP
This only works in iTerm2 compiled with image preview support, but works over
ssh.
.PP
To enable this feature, set the option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to iterm2.
.PP
This feature relies on the dimensions of the terminal's font.  By default, a
width of 8 and height of 11 are used.  To use other values, set the options
\&\f(CW\*(C`iterm2_font_width\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`iterm2_font_height\*(C'\fR to the desired values.
.PP
\fIkitty\fR
.IX Subsection "kitty"
.PP
This only works in Kitty. It requires \s-1PIL\s0 (or pillow) to work.
Allows remote image previews, for example in an ssh session.
.PP
To enable this feature, set the option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to kitty.
.PP
\fIterminology\fR
.IX Subsection "terminology"
.PP
This only works in terminology. It can render vector graphics, but works only locally.
.PP
To enable this feature, set the option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to terminology.
.PP
\fIueberzug\fR
.IX Subsection "ueberzug"
.PP
U\*:berzug is a command line utility which draws images on terminals using child
windows. It requires \s-1PIL\s0 (or pillow) and relies on X11. This makes it
compatible (in a limited way, i.e., tmux splits are not supported) with many
terminals and tmux but not the Linux console or Wayland.
.PP
To enable this feature, set the option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to ueberzug.
.PP
\fIurxvt\fR
.IX Subsection "urxvt"
.PP
This only works in urxvt compiled with pixbuf support. Does not work over ssh.
.PP
Essentially this mode sets an image as a terminal background temporarily, so it
will break any previously set image background.
.PP
To enable this feature, set the option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to urxvt.
.PP
\fIurxvt-full\fR
.IX Subsection "urxvt-full"
.PP
The same as urxvt but utilizing not only the preview pane but the whole terminal
window.
.PP
To enable this feature, set the option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to urxvt-full.
.PP
\fIw3m\fR
.IX Subsection "w3m"
.PP
This does not work over ssh, requires certain terminals (tested on \*(L"xterm\*(R" and
\&\*(L"urxvt\*(R") and is incompatible with tmux, although it works with screen.
.PP
To enable this feature, install the program \*(L"w3m\*(R" and set the option
\&\f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to w3m.
.PP
When using a terminal with a nonzero border which is not automatically detected, the w3m preview will be misaligned.
Use the \f(CW\*(C`w3m_offset\*(C'\fR option to manually adjust the image offset. This should be the same value as the terminal's border value.
.SS "\s-1SELECTION\s0"
.IX Subsection "SELECTION"
The \fIselection\fR is defined as \*(L"All marked files \s-1IF THERE ARE ANY,\s0 otherwise
the current file.\*(R"  Be aware of this when using the :delete command, which
deletes all files in the selection.
.PP
You can mark files by pressing <Space>, v, etc.  A yellow \fBMrk\fR symbol at the
bottom right indicates that there are marked files in this directory.
.SS "\s-1MACROS\s0"
.IX Subsection "MACROS"
Macros can be used in commands to abbreviate things.
.PP
.Vb 6
\& %f   the highlighted file
\& %d   the path of the current directory
\& %s   the selected files in the current directory
\& %t   all tagged files in the current directory
\& %c   the full paths of the currently copied/cut files
\& %p   the full paths of selected files
.Ve
.PP
The macros \f(CW%f\fR, \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%p\fR, and \f(CW%s\fR also have upper case variants, \f(CW%F\fR, \f(CW%D\fR, \f(CW%P\fR, and
\&\f(CW%S\fR, which refer to the next tab.  To refer to specific tabs, add a number in
between.  (%7s = selection of the seventh tab.)
.PP
\&\f(CW%c\fR is the only macro which ranges out of the current directory. So you may
\&\*(L"abuse\*(R" the copying function for other purposes, like diffing two files which
are in different directories:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& Yank the file A (type yy), move to the file B, then type
\& @diff %c %f
.Ve
.PP
Macros for file paths are generally shell-escaped so they can be used in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`shell\*(C'\fR command.
.PP
When mapping keys you can use the placeholder <any>, the key entered in that
position can be used through the \f(CW%any\fR and \f(CW%any_path\fR macros. (When using
multiple <any> placeholders you can index the macros: \f(CW%any0\fR, \f(CW%any_path0\fR, \f(CW%any1\fR,
\&\f(CW%any_path1\fR...) The macro \f(CW%any\fR will be replaced with the key pressed in the
position of the <any> placeholder. The macro \f(CW%any_path\fR will be replaced with
the path of the bookmark mapped to the key pressed in the position of the
<any> placeholder. For example this macro can be used to echo the key that was
pressed after \*(L"c\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 1
\& map c<any> echo %any
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW%any\fR is used in the ranger configuration to create a keybinding for adding a
bookmark. c<set_bookmark> creates a bookmark for the current directory and the
key for the bookmark is the first supplied argument. In this case the key
pressed after \*(L"m\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 1
\& map m<any> set_bookmark %any
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW%any_path\fR macro can be used to echo the path of the bookmark that is set to
the key pressed after \*(L"c\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 1
\& map c<any> echo %any_path
.Ve
.PP
A practical example of the use of \f(CW%any_path\fR is the pasting of cut/copied files
to a bookmarked directory:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& map p\*(Aq<any> paste dest=%any_path
.Ve
.PP
The macro \f(CW%rangerdir\fR expands to the directory of ranger's python library, you
can use it for something like this command:
 alias show_commands shell less \f(CW%rangerdir\fR/config/commands.py
.PP
\&\f(CW%confdir\fR expands to the directory given by \fB\-\-confdir\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW%datadir\fR expands to the directory given by \fB\-\-datadir\fR.
.PP
The macro \f(CW%space\fR expands to a space character. You can use it to add spaces to
the end of a command when needed, while preventing editors to strip spaces off
the end of the line automatically.
.PP
To write a literal %, you need to escape it by writing %%.
.PP
Note that macros are expanded twice when using chain. For example, to insert
a space character in a chained command, you would write %%space:
 chain command1; command2%%space
.SS "\s-1BOOKMARKS\s0"
.IX Subsection "BOOKMARKS"
Type \fBm<key>\fR to bookmark the current directory. You can re-enter this
directory by typing \fB`<key>\fR. <key> can be any letter or digit.  Unlike vim,
both lowercase and uppercase bookmarks are persistent.
.PP
Each time you jump to a bookmark, the special bookmark at key ` will be set
to the last directory. So typing \*(L"``\*(R" gets you back to where you were before.
.PP
Bookmarks are selectable when tabbing in the :cd command.
.PP
Note: The bookmarks ' (Apostrophe) and ` (Backtick) are the same.
.SS "\s-1RIFLE\s0"
.IX Subsection "RIFLE"
Rifle is the file opener of ranger.  It can be used as a standalone program or
a python module.  It is located at \fI\f(CI$repo\fI/ranger/ext/rifle.py\fR.  In contrast to
other, more simple file openers, rifle can automatically find installed
programs so it can be used effectively out of the box on a variety of systems.
.PP
It's configured in \fIrifle.conf\fR through a list of conditions and commands.
For each line the conditions are checked and if they are met, the respective
command is taken into consideration.  By default, simply the first matching
rule is used.  In ranger, you can list and choose rules by typing \*(L"r\*(R" or simply
by typing \*(L"<rulenumber><enter>\*(R".  If you use rifle standalone, you can list all
rules with the \*(L"\-l\*(R" option and pick a rule with \*(L"\-p <number>\*(R".
.PP
The rules, along with further documentation, are contained in
\&\fI\f(CI$repo\fI/ranger/config/rifle.conf\fR.
.SS "\s-1FLAGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "FLAGS"
Flags give you a way to modify the behavior of the spawned process.  They are
used in the commands \f(CW\*(C`:open_with\*(C'\fR (key \*(L"r\*(R") and \f(CW\*(C`:shell\*(C'\fR (key \*(L"!\*(R").
.PP
.Vb 6
\& f   Fork the process, i.e. run in background. Please use this flag
\&     instead of calling "disown" or "nohup", to avoid killing the
\&     background command when pressing Ctrl+C in ranger.
\& c   Run the current file only, instead of the selection
\& r   Run application with root privilege (requires sudo)
\& t   Run application in a new terminal window
.Ve
.PP
There are some additional flags that can currently be used only in the \f(CW\*(C`shell\*(C'\fR
command: (for example \f(CW\*(C`:shell \-w df\*(C'\fR)
.PP
.Vb 3
\& p   Redirect output to the pager
\& s   Silent mode.  Output will be discarded.
\& w   Wait for an Enter\-press when the process is done
.Ve
.PP
By default, all the flags are off unless otherwise specified in \fIrc.conf\fR key
bindings or \fIrifle.conf\fR rules. You can specify as many flags as you want. An
uppercase flag negates the effect: \*(L"ffcccFsf\*(R" is equivalent to \*(L"cs\*(R".
.PP
The terminal program name for the \*(L"t\*(R" flag is taken from the environment
variable \f(CW$TERMCMD\fR.  If it doesn't exist, it tries to extract it from \f(CW$TERM\fR,
uses \*(L"x\-terminal-emulator\*(R" as a fallback, and then \*(L"xterm\*(R" if that fails.
.PP
Examples: \f(CW\*(C`:open_with c\*(C'\fR will open the file that you currently point at, even
if you have selected other files.  \f(CW\*(C`:shell \-w df\*(C'\fR will run \*(L"df\*(R" and wait for
you to press Enter before switching back to ranger.
.SS "\s-1PLUGINS\s0"
.IX Subsection "PLUGINS"
ranger's plugin system consists of python files which are located in
\&\fI~/.config/ranger/plugins/\fR and are imported in alphabetical order when
starting ranger.  A plugin changes rangers behavior by overwriting or extending
a function that ranger uses.  This allows you to change pretty much every part
of ranger, but there is no guarantee that things will continue to work in
future versions as the source code evolves.
.PP
Adding new commands via a plugin as simple as specifying them like you would do
in the \fIcommands.py\fR.
.PP
There are some hooks that are specifically made for the use in plugins.  They
are functions that start with hook_ and can be found throughout the code.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& grep \*(Aqdef hook_\*(Aq \-r /path/to/rangers/source
.Ve
.PP
Also try:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& pydoc ranger.api
.Ve
.PP
Note that you should \s-1NOT\s0 simply overwrite a function unless you know what
you're doing.  Instead, save the existing function and call it from your new
one.  This way, multiple plugins can use the same hook.  There are several
sample plugins in the \fI/usr/share/doc/ranger/examples/\fR directory, including a
hello-world plugin that describes this procedure.
.SH "KEY BINDINGS"
.IX Header "KEY BINDINGS"
Key bindings are defined in the file \fI\f(CI%rangerdir\fI/config/rc.conf\fR.  Check this
file for a list of all key bindings.  You can copy it to your local
configuration directory with the \-\-copy\-config=rc option.
.PP
Many key bindings take an additional numeric argument.  Type \fI5j\fR to move
down 5 lines, \fI2l\fR to open a file in mode 2, \fI10<Space>\fR to mark 10 files.
.PP
This list contains the most useful bindings:

.IP "automatically_count_files [bool]" 4
.IX Item "automatically_count_files [bool]"
Should ranger count and display the number of files in each directory
as soon as it's visible?  This gets slow with remote file systems.  Turning it
off will still allow you to see the number of files after entering the
directory.
.IP "autosave_bookmarks [bool]" 4
.IX Item "autosave_bookmarks [bool]"
Save bookmarks (used with mX and `X) instantly?  This helps to synchronize
bookmarks between multiple ranger instances but leads to *slight* performance
loss.  When false, bookmarks are saved when ranger is exited.
.IP "autoupdate_cumulative_size [bool]" 4
.IX Item "autoupdate_cumulative_size [bool]"
You can display the \*(L"real\*(R" cumulative size of directories by using the command

If set to 'true', persistent filters would be cleared upon leaving the directory
.IP "collapse_preview [bool] <zc>" 4
.IX Item "collapse_preview [bool] <zc>"
When no preview is visible, should the last column be squeezed to make use of
the whitespace?
.IP "colorscheme [string]" 4
.IX Item "colorscheme [string]"
Which colorscheme to use?  These colorschemes are available by default:
\&\fBdefault\fR, \fBjungle\fR, \fBsnow\fR.  Snow is a monochrome scheme, jungle replaces
blue directories with green ones for better visibility on certain terminals.
.IP "column_ratios [list]" 4
.IX Item "column_ratios [list]"
How many columns are there, and what are their relative widths?  For example, a
value of 1,1,1 would mean 3 evenly sized columns. 1,1,1,1,4 means 5 columns
with the preview column being as large as the other columns combined.
.IP "confirm_on_delete [string]" 4
.IX Item "confirm_on_delete [string]"
Ask for a confirmation when running the \*(L"delete\*(R" command?  Valid values are
\&\*(L"always\*(R" (default), \*(L"never\*(R", \*(L"multiple\*(R". With \*(L"multiple\*(R", ranger will ask only

.Ve
.IP "draw_borders_multipane [string]" 4
.IX Item "draw_borders_multipane [string]"
Draw borders around or between the panes. This setting overrides
\&\fIdraw_borders\fR specifically for the multipane viewmode in case you want
different border styles in both viewmodes. There's one additional legal value
on top of those for \fIdraw_borders\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.IP "draw_progress_bar_in_status_bar [bool]" 4
.IX Item "draw_progress_bar_in_status_bar [bool]"
Draw a progress bar in the status bar which displays the average state of all
currently running tasks which support progress bars?
.IP "flushinput [bool] <zi>" 4
.IX Item "flushinput [bool] <zi>"
Flush the input after each key hit?  One advantage is that when scrolling down
with \*(L"j\*(R", ranger stops scrolling instantly when you release the key.  One
disadvantage is that when you type commands blindly, some keys might get lost.
.IP "freeze_files [bool] <F>" 4
.IX Item "freeze_files [bool] <F>"
When active, directories and files will not be loaded, improving performance
when all the files you need are already loaded.  This does not affect file
previews.
.IP "global_inode_type_filter [string]" 4

.IP "idle_delay [integer]" 4
.IX Item "idle_delay [integer]"
The delay that ranger idly waits for user input, in milliseconds, with a
resolution of 100ms.  Lower delay reduces lag between directory updates but
increases \s-1CPU\s0 load.
.IP "iterm2_font_height [integer]" 4

.Ve
.PP
There are additional commands which are directly translated to python
functions, one for every method in the ranger.core.actions.Actions class.
They are not documented here, since they are mostly for key bindings, not to be
typed in by a user.  Read the source if you are interested in them.
.PP
These are the public commands including their descriptions:
.IP "alias [\fInewcommand\fR] [\fIoldcommand\fR]" 2
.IX Item "alias [newcommand] [oldcommand]"
Copies the oldcommand as newcommand.
.IP "bulkrename" 2
.IX Item "bulkrename"
This command opens a list of selected files in an external editor.  After you
edit and save the file, it will generate a shell script which does bulk
renaming according to the changes you did in the file.
.Sp
This shell script is opened in an editor for you to review.  After you close
it, it will be executed.
.IP "cd [\fIpath\fR]" 2
.IX Item "cd [path]"
The cd command changes the directory.  If path is a file, selects that file.
The command \f(CW\*(C`:cd \-\*(C'\fR is equivalent to typing ``.
.IP "chain \fIcommand1\fR[; \fIcommand2\fR[; \fIcommand3\fR...]]" 2
.IX Item "chain command1[; command2[; command3...]]"
Combines multiple commands into one, separated by semicolons.
.IP "chmod \fIoctal_number\fR" 2
.IX Item "chmod octal_number"
Sets the permissions of the selection to the octal number.
.Sp
The octal number is between 000 and 777. The digits specify the permissions for
the user, the group and others.  A 1 permits execution, a 2 permits writing, a
4 permits reading.  Add those numbers to combine them. So a 7 permits
everything.
.Sp
Key bindings in the form of [\-+]<who><what> and <octal>= also exist.  For
example, \fB+ar\fR allows reading for everyone, \-ow forbids others to write and
777= allows everything.
.Sp
See also: man 1 chmod
.IP "console [\-p\fIN\fR | \-s \fIsentinel\fR] \fIcommand\fR" 2
.IX Item "console [-pN | -s sentinel] command"
Opens the console with the command already typed in. The cursor is placed at
\&\fIN\fR or at the first occurrence of \fIsentinel\fR. Note that sentinel strings can
potentially occur inside macro expansions. If you cannot provide a sentinel,
which is guaranteed to be unique, you should use \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR.
.IP "copymap  \fIkey\fR \fInewkey\fR [\fInewkey2\fR ...]" 2
.IX Item "copymap key newkey [newkey2 ...]"
.PD 0
.IP "copycmap \fIkey\fR \fInewkey\fR [\fInewkey2\fR ...]" 2
.IX Item "copycmap key newkey [newkey2 ...]"
.IP "copypmap \fIkey\fR \fInewkey\fR [\fInewkey2\fR ...]" 2
.IX Item "copypmap key newkey [newkey2 ...]"
.IP "copytmap \fIkey\fR \fInewkey\fR [\fInewkey2\fR ...]" 2
.IX Item "copytmap key newkey [newkey2 ...]"
.PD
Copies the keybinding \fIkey\fR to \fInewkey\fR in the \*(L"browser\*(R" context.  This is a
deep copy, so if you change the new binding (or parts of it) later, the old one
is not modified. For example, \fIcopymap j down\fR will make the key sequence
\&\*(L"down\*(R" move the cursor down one item.
.Sp
To copy key bindings of the console, pager or taskview use \*(L"copycmap\*(R",
\&\*(L"copypmap\*(R" or \*(L"copytmap\*(R" respectively.
.IP "default_linemode [\fIpath=regexp\fR | \fItag=tags\fR] \fIlinemodename\fR" 2
.IX Item "default_linemode [path=regexp | tag=tags] linemodename"

.Sp
Set the default linemode to \*(L"permissions\*(R" for all files tagged with \*(L"p\*(R" or \*(L"P\*(R":
 :default_linemode tag=pP permissions
.Sp
Set the default linemode for all files in ~/books/ to \*(L"metatitle\*(R":
 :default_linemode path=/home/.*?/books/.* metatitle
.IP "delete" 2
.IX Item "delete"
Destroy all files in the selection with a roundhouse kick.  ranger will ask for
a confirmation if you attempt to delete multiple (marked) files or non-empty
directories.  This can be changed by modifying the setting \*(L"confirm_on_delete\*(R".

.IX Item "echo text"
Display the text in the statusbar.
.IP "edit [\fIfilename\fR]" 2

text, use the function `p'.  The result is displayed on the screen unless you
use the \*(L"\-q\*(R" option.
.Sp
Examples:
 :eval fm
 :eval len(fm.tabs)
 :eval p(\*(L"Hello World!\*(R")
.IP "filter [\fIstring\fR]" 2
.IX Item "filter [string]"

.IX Item "filter_inode_type [dfl]"
Displays only the files of specified inode type. To display only directories,
use the 'd' parameter. To display only files, use the 'f' parameter. To display
only links, use the 'l' parameter. Parameters can be combined. To remove this
filter, use no parameter.
.IP "filter_stack [\fIcommand\fR [\fIargs\fR]]" 2
.IX Item "filter_stack [command [args]]"
Manage the filter stack, adding, removing and manipulating filters. For
example, to show only duplicate files and symlinks:

.Sp
Flags:
 \-a    Position before all extensions
 \-r    Remove everything before extensions
.IP "save_copy_buffer" 2
.IX Item "save_copy_buffer"
Save the copy buffer to \fI~/.config/ranger/copy_buffer\fR.  This can be used to
pass the list of copied files to another ranger instance.
.IP "scout [\-\fIflags\fR...] [\-\-] \fIpattern\fR" 2
.IX Item "scout [-flags...] [--] pattern"
Swiss army knife command for searching, traveling and filtering files.
.Sp
Flags:
 \-a    Automatically open a file on unambiguous match
 \-e    Open the selected file when pressing enter
 \-f    Filter files that match the current search pattern
 \-g    Interpret pattern as a glob pattern
 \-i    Ignore the letter case of the files
 \-k    Keep the console open when changing a directory with the command
 \-l    Letter skipping; e.g. allow \*(L"rdme\*(R" to match the file \*(L"readme\*(R"
 \-m    Mark the matching files after pressing enter
 \-M    Unmark the matching files after pressing enter
 \-p    Permanent filter: hide non-matching files after pressing enter

 \-s    Smart case; like \-i unless pattern contains upper case letters
 \-t    Apply filter and search pattern as you type
 \-v    Inverts the match
.Sp
Multiple flags can be combined.  For example, \*(L":scout \-gpt\*(R" would create
a :filter\-like command using globbing.
.IP "search \fIpattern\fR" 2
.IX Item "search pattern"
Search files in the current directory that match the given (case insensitive)
regular expression pattern.
.Sp
This command is based on the \fIscout\fR command and supports all of its options.
.IP "search_inc \fIpattern\fR" 2
.IX Item "search_inc pattern"
Search files in the current directory that match the given (case insensitive)
regular expression pattern.  This command gets you to matching files as you
type.

.IP "set \fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR" 2
.IX Item "set option value"
Assigns a new value to an option.  Valid options are listed in the settings
section.  Use tab completion to get the current value of an option, though this
doesn't work for functions and regular expressions. Valid values are:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\& setting type   | example values
\& \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\& bool           | true, false

.Ve
.IP "setintag \fItags\fR \fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR" 2
.IX Item "setintag tags option value"
Assigns a new value to an option, but locally for the directories that are
marked with \fItag\fR.  This means, that this option only takes effect when
visiting that directory.
.Sp
For example, to change the sorting order in your downloads directory, tag it
with the \fIv\fR tag by typing \fI"v\fR, then use this command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& setintag v sort ctime
.Ve
.IP "setlocal [path=\fIpath\fR] \fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR" 2
.IX Item "setlocal [path=path] option value"
Assigns a new value to an option, but locally for the directory given by
\&\fIpath\fR. This means, that this option only takes effect when visiting that
directory. If no path is given, uses the current directory.
.Sp
\&\fIpath\fR is a regular expression.  This means that \f(CW\*(C`path=~/dl\*(C'\fR applies to all
paths that start with \fI~/dl\fR, e.g. \fI~/dl2\fR and \fI~/dl/foo\fR. To avoid this,
use \f(CW\*(C`path=~/dl$\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIpath\fR can be quoted with either single or double quotes to prevent unwanted
splitting. \fIpath='~/dl dl$'\fR or \fIpath=\*(L"~/dl dl$\*(R"\fR
.IP "shell [\-\fIflags\fR] \fIcommand\fR" 2

.IP "touch \fIfilename\fR" 2
.IX Item "touch filename"
Creates an empty file with the name \fIfilename\fR, unless it already exists.
.IP "trash" 2
.IX Item "trash"
Move all files in the selection to the trash using rifle. Rifle tries to use a
trash manager like \fItrash-cli\fR if available but will fall back to moving files
to either \fI\f(CI$XDG_DATA_HOME\fI/ranger/trash\fR or \fI~/.local/share/ranger/trash\fR.
This is a less permanent version of \fIdelete\fR, relying on the user to clear out
the trash whenever it's convenient. While having the possibility of restoring
trashed files until this happens. ranger will ask for a confirmation if you
attempt to trash multiple (marked) files or non-empty directories. This can be
changed by modifying the setting \*(L"confirm_on_delete\*(R".
.IP "travel \fIpattern\fR" 2
.IX Item "travel pattern"
Filters the current directory for files containing the letters in the
string, possibly with other letters in between.  The filter is applied as
you type.  When only one directory is left, it is entered and the console
is automatically reopened, allowing for fast travel.
To close the console, press \s-1ESC\s0 or execute a file.
.Sp
This command is based on the \fIscout\fR command and supports all of its options.

.IP "unmark_tag [\fItags\fR]" 2
.IX Item "unmark_tag [tags]"
Unmark all tags that are tagged with either of the given tags.  When leaving
out the tag argument, all tagged files are unmarked.
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
ranger reads several configuration files which are located in
\&\fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.config/ranger\fR or \fI\f(CI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fI/ranger\fR if \f(CW$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is
defined.  You can use the \-\-copy\-config option to obtain the default
configuration files.  The files contain further documentation.
.PP
\&\fIrc.conf\fR, \fIcommands.py\fR and \fIcolorschemes\fR do not need to be copied fully
as they will only be adding to the default configuration files except if explicitly
overridden. This may lead to some confusing situations, for example when a key is
being bound despite the corresponding line being removed from the user's copy of
the configuration file. This behavior may be disabled with an environment
variable (see also: \fB\s-1ENVIRONMENT\s0\fR). Note: All other configuration files only
read from one source; i.e. default \s-1OR\s0 user, not both.
\&\fIrc.conf\fR and \fIcommands.py\fR are additionally read from \fI/etc/ranger\fR if they
exist for system-wide configuration, user configuration overrides system
configuration which overrides the default configuration.
.PP
When starting ranger with the \fB\-\-clean\fR option, it will not access or create
any of these files.
