ranger is a console file manager with \s-1VI\s0 key bindings.
.SH "RESOURCES"
.IX Header "RESOURCES"
\&\fIThis manual\fR contains instructions on how to use and configure ranger.
.PP
\&\fIInside ranger\fR, you can press \fI?\fR for a list of key bindings, commands or
settings.
.PP
The \fI\s-1README\s0\fR contains install instructions.
.PP
The file \fI\s-1HACKING\s0.md\fR contains guidelines for code modification.
.PP
The directory \fIdoc/configs\fR contains configuration files.  They are usually
installed to \fI/usr/share/doc/ranger/config\fR and can be obtained with ranger's
\&\-\-copy\-config option.
.PP
The directory \fIexamples\fR contains reference implementations for ranger
plugins, sample configuration files and some programs for integrating ranger
with other software.  They are usually installed to
\&\fI/usr/share/doc/ranger/examples\fR.
.PP
The man page of \fIrifle\fR\|(1) describes the functions of the file opener
.PP
The section \fI\s-1LINKS\s0\fR of this man page contains further resources.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR" 14
.IX Item "-d, --debug"
Activate the debug mode: Whenever an error occurs, ranger will exit and print a
full traceback.  The default behavior is to merely print the name of the
exception in the statusbar/log and try to keep running.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR" 14
.IX Item "-c, --clean"
Activate the clean mode:  ranger will not access or create any configuration
files nor will it leave any traces on your system.  This is useful when your
configuration is broken, when you want to avoid clutter, etc.
.IP "\fB\-\-cachedir\fR=\fIdir\fR" 14
.IX Item "--cachedir=dir"
Change the cache directory of ranger from \f(CW$XDG_CACHE_HOME\fR or ~/.cache/ranger to \*(L"dir\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-r\fR \fIdir\fR, \fB\-\-confdir\fR=\fIdir\fR" 14
.IX Item "-r dir, --confdir=dir"
Change the configuration directory of ranger from \f(CW$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR or ~/.config/ranger to \*(L"dir\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-\-datadir\fR=\fIdir\fR" 14
.IX Item "--datadir=dir"
Change the data directory of ranger from \f(CW$XDG_DATA_HOME\fR or ~/.local/share/ranger to \*(L"dir\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-\-copy\-config\fR=\fIfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--copy-config=file"
Create copies of the default configuration files in your local configuration
directory.  Existing ones will not be overwritten.  Possible values: \fIall\fR,
\&\fIcommands\fR, \fIcommands_full\fR, \fIrc\fR, \fIrifle\fR, \fIscope\fR.
.Sp
Note: You may want to disable loading of the global configuration files by
exporting \fIRANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC=FALSE\fR in your environment.  See also:
\&\fB\s-1FILES\s0\fR, \fB\s-1ENVIRONMENT\s0\fR
.Sp
\&\-\-copy\-config=\fBcommands\fR will copy only a small sample configuration file with
a thoroughly commented example.  It is recommended to keep this file tidy to
avoid getting defunct commands on ranger upgrades.  The full default
commands.py can be copied with \-\-copy\-config=\fBcommands_full\fR, but that file
will be ignored by ranger and serves only as a reference for making your own
commands.
.IP "\fB\-\-choosefile\fR=\fItargetfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--choosefile=targetfile"
Allows you to pick a file with ranger.  This changes the behavior so that when
you open a file, ranger will exit and write the absolute path of that file into
\&\fItargetfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-choosefiles\fR=\fItargetfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--choosefiles=targetfile"
Allows you to pick multiple files with ranger.  This changes the behavior so
that when you open a file, ranger will exit and write the absolute paths of all
selected files into \fItargetfile\fR, adding one newline after each filename.
.IP "\fB\-\-choosedir\fR=\fItargetfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--choosedir=targetfile"
Allows you to pick a directory with ranger.  When you exit ranger, it will
write the last visited directory into \fItargetfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-selectfile\fR=\fItargetfile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--selectfile=targetfile"
Open ranger with \fItargetfile\fR selected.
.IP "\fB\-\-show\-only\-dirs\fR" 14
.IX Item "--show-only-dirs"
Display only the directories. May be used in conjunction with
\&\fB\-\-choosedir\fR=\fItargetfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-list\-unused\-keys\fR" 14
.IX Item "--list-unused-keys"
List common keys which are not bound to any action in the \*(L"browser\*(R" context.
This list is not complete, you can bind any key that is supported by curses:
use the key code returned by \f(CW\*(C`getch()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-list\-tagged\-files\fR=\fItag\fR" 14
.IX Item "--list-tagged-files=tag"
List all files which are tagged with the given tag.  Note: Tags are single
characters.  The default tag is \*(L"*\*(R"
.IP "\fB\-\-profile\fR" 14
.IX Item "--profile"
Print statistics of \s-1CPU\s0 usage on exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-cmd\fR=\fIcommand\fR" 14
.IX Item "--cmd=command"
Execute the command after the configuration has been read.  Use this option
multiple times to run multiple commands.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 14
.IX Item "--version"
Print the version and exit.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 14
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print a list of options and exit.
.SH "CONCEPTS"
.IX Header "CONCEPTS"
This part explains how certain parts of ranger work and how they can be used
efficiently.
.SS "\s-1TAGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "TAGS"
Tags are single characters which are displayed left of a filename.  You can use
tags however you want.  Press \*(L"t\*(R" to toggle tags and \*(L"ut\*(R" to remove any tags of
the selection. The default tag is an Asterisk (\*(L"*\*(R"), but you can use any tag by
typing \fI"<tagname>\fR.
.SS "\s-1PREVIEWS\s0"
.IX Subsection "PREVIEWS"
By default, only text files are previewed, but you can enable external preview
scripts by setting the option \f(CW\*(C`use_preview_script\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`preview_files\*(C'\fR to true.
.PP
This default script is \fI~/.config/ranger/scope.sh\fR. It contains more
documentation and calls to the programs \fIlynx\fR and \fIelinks\fR for html,
\&\fIhighlight\fR for text/code, \fIimg2txt\fR for images, \fIatool\fR for archives,
\&\fIpdftotext\fR for PDFs and \fImediainfo\fR for video and audio files.
.PP
Install these programs (just the ones you need) and scope.sh will automatically
use them.
.PP
Independently of the preview script, there is a feature to preview images
by drawing them directly into the terminal. To enable this feature, set the
option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images\*(C'\fR to true and enable one of the image preview modes:
.PP
\fIw3m\fR
.IX Subsection "w3m"
.PP
This does not work over ssh, requires certain terminals (tested on \*(L"xterm\*(R" and
\&\*(L"urxvt\*(R") and is incompatible with tmux, although it works with screen.
.PP
To enable this feature, install the program \*(L"w3m\*(R" and set the option
\&\f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to w3m.
.PP
\fIiTerm2\fR
.IX Subsection "iTerm2"
.PP
This only works in iTerm2 compiled with image preview support, but works over
ssh.
.PP
To enable this feature, set the option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to iterm2.
.PP
\fIurxvt\fR
.IX Subsection "urxvt"
.PP
This only works in urxvt compiled with pixbuf support. Does not work over ssh.
.PP
Essentially this mode sets an image as a terminal background temporarily, so it
will break any previously set image background.
.PP
To enable this feature, set the option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to urxvt.
.PP
\fIurxvt-full\fR
.IX Subsection "urxvt-full"
.PP
The same as urxvt but utilizing not only the preview pane but the whole terminal
window.
.PP
To enable this feature, set the option \f(CW\*(C`preview_images_method\*(C'\fR to urxvt-full.
.SS "\s-1SELECTION\s0"
.IX Subsection "SELECTION"
The \fIselection\fR is defined as \*(L"All marked files \s-1IF THERE ARE ANY,\s0 otherwise
the current file.\*(R"  Be aware of this when using the :delete command, which
deletes all files in the selection.
.PP
You can mark files by pressing <Space>, v, etc.  A yellow \fBMrk\fR symbol at the
bottom right indicates that there are marked files in this directory.
.SS "\s-1MACROS\s0"
.IX Subsection "MACROS"
Macros can be used in commands to abbreviate things.
.PP
.Vb 6
\& %f   the highlighted file
\& %d   the path of the current directory
\& %s   the selected files in the current directory
\& %t   all tagged files in the current directory
\& %c   the full paths of the currently copied/cut files
\& %p   the full paths of selected files
.Ve
.PP
The macros \f(CW%f\fR, \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%p\fR, and \f(CW%s\fR also have upper case variants, \f(CW%F\fR, \f(CW%D\fR, \f(CW%P\fR, and
\&\f(CW%S\fR, which refer to the next tab.  To refer to specific tabs, add a number in
between.  (%7s = selection of the seventh tab.)
.PP
\&\f(CW%c\fR is the only macro which ranges out of the current directory. So you may
\&\*(L"abuse\*(R" the copying function for other purposes, like diffing two files which
are in different directories:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& Yank the file A (type yy), move to the file B, then type
\& @diff %c %f
.Ve
.PP
Macros for file paths are generally shell-escaped so they can be used in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`shell\*(C'\fR command.
.PP
Additionally, if you create a key binding that uses <any>, a special statement
which accepts any key, then the macro \f(CW%any\fR (or \f(CW%any0\fR, \f(CW%any1\fR, \f(CW%any2\fR, ...) can be
used in the command to get the key that was pressed.
.PP
The macro \f(CW%rangerdir\fR expands to the directory of ranger's python library, you
can use it for something like this command:
  alias show_commands shell less \f(CW%rangerdir\fR/config/commands.py
.PP
\&\f(CW%confdir\fR expands to the directory given by \fB\-\-confdir\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW%datadir\fR expands to the directory given by \fB\-\-datadir\fR.
.PP
The macro \f(CW%space\fR expands to a space character. You can use it to add spaces to
the end of a command when needed, while preventing editors to strip spaces off
the end of the line automatically.
.PP
To write a literal %, you need to escape it by writing %%.
.SS "\s-1BOOKMARKS\s0"
.IX Subsection "BOOKMARKS"
Type \fBm<key>\fR to bookmark the current directory. You can re-enter this
directory by typing \fB`<key>\fR. <key> can be any letter or digit.  Unlike vim,
both lowercase and uppercase bookmarks are persistent.
.PP
Each time you jump to a bookmark, the special bookmark at key ` will be set
to the last directory. So typing \*(L"``\*(R" gets you back to where you were before.
.PP
Bookmarks are selectable when tabbing in the :cd command.
.PP
Note: The bookmarks ' (Apostrophe) and ` (Backtick) are the same.
.SS "\s-1RIFLE\s0"
.IX Subsection "RIFLE"
Rifle is the file opener of ranger.  It can be used as a standalone program or
a python module.  It is located at \fIranger/ext/rifle.py\fR.  In contrast to
other, more simple file openers, rifle can automatically find installed
programs so it can be used effectively out of the box on a variety of systems.
.PP
It's configured in \fIrifle.conf\fR through a list of conditions and commands.
For each line the conditions are checked and if they are met, the respective
command is taken into consideration.  By default, simply the first matching
rule is used.  In ranger, you can list and choose rules by typing \*(L"r\*(R" or simply
by typing \*(L"<rulenumber><enter>\*(R".  If you use rifle standalone, you can list all
rules with the \*(L"\-l\*(R" option and pick a rule with \*(L"\-p <number>\*(R".
.PP
The rules, along with further documentation, are contained in
\&\fIranger/config/rifle.conf\fR.
.SS "\s-1FLAGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "FLAGS"
Flags give you a way to modify the behavior of the spawned process.  They are
used in the commands \f(CW\*(C`:open_with\*(C'\fR (key \*(L"r\*(R") and \f(CW\*(C`:shell\*(C'\fR (key \*(L"!\*(R").
.PP
.Vb 4
\& f   Fork the process.  (Run in background)
\& c   Run the current file only, instead of the selection
\& r   Run application with root privilege (requires sudo)
\& t   Run application in a new terminal window
.Ve
.PP
There are some additional flags that can currently be used only in the \f(CW\*(C`shell\*(C'\fR
command: (for example \f(CW\*(C`:shell \-w df\*(C'\fR)
.PP
.Vb 3
\& p   Redirect output to the pager
\& s   Silent mode.  Output will be discarded.
\& w   Wait for an Enter\-press when the process is done
.Ve
.PP
By default, all the flags are off unless specified otherwise in the
\&\fIrifle.conf\fR configuration file.  You can specify as many flags as you want.
An uppercase flag negates the effect: \*(L"ffcccFsf\*(R" is equivalent to \*(L"cs\*(R".
.PP
The terminal program name for the \*(L"t\*(R" flag is taken from the environment
variable \f(CW$TERMCMD\fR.  If it doesn't exist, it tries to extract it from \f(CW$TERM\fR and
uses \*(L"xterm\*(R" as a fallback if that fails.
.PP
Examples: \f(CW\*(C`:open_with c\*(C'\fR will open the file that you currently point at, even
if you have selected other files.  \f(CW\*(C`:shell \-w df\*(C'\fR will run \*(L"df\*(R" and wait for
you to press Enter before switching back to ranger.
.SS "\s-1PLUGINS\s0"
.IX Subsection "PLUGINS"
ranger's plugin system consists of python files which are located in
\&\fI~/.config/ranger/plugins/\fR and are imported in alphabetical order when
starting ranger.  A plugin changes rangers behavior by overwriting or extending
a function that ranger uses.  This allows you to change pretty much every part
of ranger, but there is no guarantee that things will continue to work in
future versions as the source code evolves.
.PP
Adding new commands via a plugin as simple as specifying them like you would do
in the \fIcommands.py\fR.
.PP
There are some hooks that are specifically made for the use in plugins.  They
are functions that start with hook_ and can be found throughout the code.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& grep \*(Aqdef hook_\*(Aq \-r /path/to/rangers/source
.Ve
.PP
Also try:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& pydoc ranger.api
.Ve
.PP
Note that you should \s-1NOT\s0 simply overwrite a function unless you know what
you're doing.  Instead, save the existing function and call it from your new
one.  This way, multiple plugins can use the same hook.  There are several
sample plugins in the \fI/usr/share/doc/ranger/examples/\fR directory, including a
hello-world plugin that describes this procedure.
.SH "KEY BINDINGS"
.IX Header "KEY BINDINGS"
Key bindings are defined in the file \fIranger/config/rc.conf\fR.  Check this
file for a list of all key bindings.  You can copy it to your local
configuration directory with the \-\-copy\-config=rc option.
.PP
Many key bindings take an additional numeric argument.  Type \fI5j\fR to move
down 5 lines, \fI2l\fR to open a file in mode 2, \fI10<Space>\fR to mark 10 files.
.PP
This list contains the most useful bindings:

This section lists all built-in settings of ranger.  The valid types for the
value are in [brackets].  The hotkey to toggle the setting is in <brokets>, if
a hotkey exists.
.PP
Settings can be changed in the file \fI~/.config/ranger/rc.conf\fR or on the
fly with the command \fB:set option value\fR.  Examples:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& set column_ratios 1,2,3
\& set show_hidden true
.Ve
.PP
Toggling options can be done with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set show_hidden!
.Ve
.PP
The different types of settings and an example for each type:
.PP
.Vb 7
\& setting type   | example values
\& \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\& bool           | true, false
\& integer        | 1, 23, 1337
\& string         | foo, hello world
\& list           | 1,2,3,4
\& none           | none
.Ve
.PP
You can view a list of all settings and their current values by pressing \*(L"3?\*(R"
in ranger.
.IP "automatically_count_files [bool]" 4
.IX Item "automatically_count_files [bool]"
Should ranger count and display the number of files in each directory
as soon as it's visible?  This gets slow with remote file sytems.  Turning it
off will still allow you to see the number of files after entering the
directory.
.IP "autosave_bookmarks [bool]" 4
.IX Item "autosave_bookmarks [bool]"
Save bookmarks (used with mX and `X) instantly?  This helps to synchronize
bookmarks between multiple ranger instances but leads to *slight* performance
loss.  When false, bookmarks are saved when ranger is exited.
.IP "autoupdate_cumulative_size [bool]" 4
.IX Item "autoupdate_cumulative_size [bool]"
You can display the \*(L"real\*(R" cumulative size of directories by using the command
:get_cumulative_size or typing \*(L"dc\*(R".  The size is expensive to calculate and
will not be updated automatically.  You can choose to update it automatically
though by turning on this option.
.IP "cd_bookmarks [bool]" 4
.IX Item "cd_bookmarks [bool]"
Specify whether bookmarks should be included in the tab completion of the \*(L"cd\*(R"
command.
.IP "cd_tab_case [string]" 4
.IX Item "cd_tab_case [string]"
Changes case sensitivity for the \*(L"cd\*(R" command tab completion. Possible values are:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& sensitive
\& insensitive
\& smart
.Ve
.IP "cd_tab_smart [bool]" 4
.IX Item "cd_tab_smart [bool]"
Use smart tab completion with less typing? E.g. \*(L":cd /f/b/b<tab>\*(R" yields \*(L":cd /foo/bar/baz\*(R".
.IP "clear_filters_on_dir_change [bool]" 4
.IX Item "clear_filters_on_dir_change [bool]"
If set to 'true', persistent filters would be cleared upon leaving the directory
.IP "collapse_preview [bool] <zc>" 4
.IX Item "collapse_preview [bool] <zc>"
When no preview is visible, should the last column be squeezed to make use of
the whitespace?
.IP "colorscheme [string]" 4
.IX Item "colorscheme [string]"
Which colorscheme to use?  These colorschemes are available by default:
\&\fBdefault\fR, \fBjungle\fR, \fBsnow\fR.  Snow is a monochrome scheme, jungle replaces
blue directories with green ones for better visibility on certain terminals.
.IP "column_ratios [list]" 4
.IX Item "column_ratios [list]"
How many columns are there, and what are their relative widths?  For example, a
value of 1,1,1 would mean 3 evenly sized columns. 1,1,1,1,4 means 5 columns
with the preview column being as large as the other columns combined.
.IP "confirm_on_delete [string]" 4
.IX Item "confirm_on_delete [string]"
Ask for a confirmation when running the \*(L"delete\*(R" command?  Valid values are
\&\*(L"always\*(R" (default), \*(L"never\*(R", \*(L"multiple\*(R". With \*(L"multiple\*(R", ranger will ask only
if you delete multiple files at once.

currently running tasks which support progress bars?
.IP "flushinput [bool] <zi>" 4
.IX Item "flushinput [bool] <zi>"
Flush the input after each key hit?  One advantage is that when scrolling down
with \*(L"j\*(R", ranger stops scrolling instantly when you release the key.  One
disadvantage is that when you type commands blindly, some keys might get lost.
.IP "hidden_filter [string]" 4
.IX Item "hidden_filter [string]"
A regular expression pattern for files which should be hidden.  For example,
this pattern will hide all files that start with a dot or end with a tilde.
.Sp

.Ve
.IP "idle_delay [integer]" 4
.IX Item "idle_delay [integer]"
The delay that ranger idly waits for user input, in milliseconds, with a
resolution of 100ms.  Lower delay reduces lag between directory updates but
increases \s-1CPU\s0 load.
.IP "line_numbers [string]" 4
.IX Item "line_numbers [string]"
Show line numbers in main column.  Possible values are:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& false      turn the feature off

.IP "metadata_deep_search [bool]" 4
.IX Item "metadata_deep_search [bool]"
When the metadata manager module looks for metadata, should it only look for a
\&\*(L".metadata.json\*(R" file in the current directory, or do a deep search and check
all directories above the current one as well?
.IP "mouse_enabled [bool] <zm>" 4
.IX Item "mouse_enabled [bool] <zm>"
Enable mouse input?
.IP "padding_right [bool]" 4
.IX Item "padding_right [bool]"
When collapse_preview is on and there is no preview, should there remain a
little padding on the right?  This allows you to click into that space to run
the file.
.IP "preview_directories [bool] <zP>" 4
.IX Item "preview_directories [bool] <zP>"
Preview directories in the preview column?
.IP "preview_files [bool] <zp>" 4
.IX Item "preview_files [bool] <zp>"

to disable this feature.
.IP "preview_script [string, none]" 4
.IX Item "preview_script [string, none]"
Which script should handle generating previews?  If the file doesn't exist, or
use_preview_script is off, ranger will handle previews itself by just printing
the content.
.IP "save_console_history [bool]" 4
.IX Item "save_console_history [bool]"
Should the console history be saved on exit?  If disabled, the console history
is reset when you restart ranger.
.IP "save_tabs_on_exit [bool]" 4
.IX Item "save_tabs_on_exit [bool]"
Save all tabs, except the active, on exit? The last saved tabs are restored once
when starting the next session. Multiple sessions are stored in a stack and the
oldest saved tabs are restored first.
.IP "scroll_offset [integer]" 4
.IX Item "scroll_offset [integer]"
Try to keep this much space between the top/bottom border when scrolling.
.IP "shorten_title [integer]" 4
.IX Item "shorten_title [integer]"
Trim the title of the window if it gets long?  The number defines how many
directories are displayed at once. A value of 0 turns off this feature.

.IX Item "sort_directories_first [bool] <zd>"
Sort directories first?
.IP "sort_reverse [bool] <or>" 4
.IX Item "sort_reverse [bool] <or>"
Reverse the order of files?
.IP "sort_unicode [bool]" 4
.IX Item "sort_unicode [bool]"
When sorting according to some string, should the unicode characters be
compared, instead of looking at the raw character values to save time?
.IP "sort [string] <oa>, <ob>, <oc>, <oe>, <om>, <on>, <ot>, <os>, <oz>" 4
.IX Item "sort [string] <oa>, <ob>, <oc>, <oe>, <om>, <on>, <ot>, <os>, <oz>"

.Ve
.PP
There are additional commands which are directly translated to python
functions, one for every method in the ranger.core.actions.Actions class.
They are not documented here, since they are mostly for key bindings, not to be
typed in by a user.  Read the source if you are interested in them.
.PP
These are the public commands including their descriptions:
.IP "alias [\fInewcommand\fR] [\fIoldcommand\fR]" 2
.IX Item "alias [newcommand] [oldcommand]"
Copies the oldcommand as newcommand.
.IP "bulkrename" 2
.IX Item "bulkrename"
This command opens a list of selected files in an external editor.  After you
edit and save the file, it will generate a shell script which does bulk
renaming according to the changes you did in the file.
.Sp
This shell script is opened in an editor for you to review.  After you close
it, it will be executed.
.IP "cd [\fIdirectory\fR]" 2
.IX Item "cd [directory]"
The cd command changes the directory.  The command \f(CW\*(C`:cd \-\*(C'\fR is equivalent to
typing ``.
.IP "chain \fIcommand1\fR[; \fIcommand2\fR[; \fIcommand3\fR...]]" 2
.IX Item "chain command1[; command2[; command3...]]"
Combines multiple commands into one, separated by semicolons.
.IP "chmod \fIoctal_number\fR" 2
.IX Item "chmod octal_number"
Sets the permissions of the selection to the octal number.
.Sp
The octal number is between 000 and 777. The digits specify the permissions for
the user, the group and others.  A 1 permits execution, a 2 permits writing, a
4 permits reading.  Add those numbers to combine them. So a 7 permits
everything.
.Sp
Key bindings in the form of [\-+]<who><what> and <octal>= also exist.  For
example, \fB+ar\fR allows reading for everyone, \-ow forbids others to write and
777= allows everything.
.Sp
See also: man 1 chmod
.IP "cmap \fIkey\fR \fIcommand\fR" 2
.IX Item "cmap key command"
Binds keys for the console. Works like the \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR command.

.IX Item "copycmap key newkey [newkey2 ...]"
See \f(CW\*(C`copymap\*(C'\fR
.IP "copymap \fIkey\fR \fInewkey\fR [\fInewkey2\fR ...]" 2
.IX Item "copymap key newkey [newkey2 ...]"
Copies the keybinding \fIkey\fR to \fInewkey\fR in the \*(L"browser\*(R" context.  This is a
deep copy, so if you change the new binding (or parts of it) later, the old one
is not modified.
.Sp
To copy key bindings of the console, taskview, or pager use \*(L"copycmap\*(R",
\&\*(L"copytmap\*(R" or \*(L"copypmap\*(R".
.IP "copypmap \fIkey\fR \fInewkey\fR [\fInewkey2\fR ...]" 2
.IX Item "copypmap key newkey [newkey2 ...]"
See \f(CW\*(C`copymap\*(C'\fR
.IP "copytmap \fIkey\fR \fInewkey\fR [\fInewkey2\fR ...]" 2
.IX Item "copytmap key newkey [newkey2 ...]"
See \f(CW\*(C`copymap\*(C'\fR
.IP "cunmap [\fIkeys...\fR]" 2
.IX Item "cunmap [keys...]"
Removes key mappings of the console. Works like the \f(CW\*(C`unmap\*(C'\fR command.

 :default_linemode tag=pP permissions
.Sp
Set the default linemode for all files in ~/books/ to \*(L"metatitle\*(R":
 :default_linemode path=/home/.*?/books/.* metatitle
.IP "delete" 2
.IX Item "delete"
Destroy all files in the selection with a roundhouse kick.  ranger will ask for
a confirmation if you attempt to delete multiple (marked) files or non-empty
directories.  This can be changed by modifying the setting \*(L"confirm_on_delete\*(R".
.IP "echo \fItext\fR" 2
.IX Item "echo text"
Display the text in the statusbar.
.IP "edit [\fIfilename\fR]" 2

.Sp
Examples:
 :eval fm
 :eval len(fm.tabs)
 :eval p(\*(L"Hello World!\*(R")
.IP "filter [\fIstring\fR]" 2
.IX Item "filter [string]"
Displays only the files which contain the \fIstring\fR in their basename.  Running
this command without any parameter will reset the filter.
.Sp
This command is based on the \fIscout\fR command and supports all of its options.
.IP "filter_inode_type [dfl]" 2
.IX Item "filter_inode_type [dfl]"
Displays only the files of specified inode type. To display only directories,
use the 'd' parameter. To display only files, use the 'f' parameter. To display
only links, use the 'l' parameter. Parameters can be combined. To remove this
filter, use no parameter.
.IP "find \fIpattern\fR" 2
.IX Item "find pattern"

paths that start with \fI~/dl\fR, e.g. \fI~/dl2\fR and \fI~/dl/foo\fR. To avoid this,
use \f(CW\*(C`path=~/dl$\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIpath\fR can be quoted with either single or double quotes to prevent unwanted
splitting. \fIpath='~/dl dl$'\fR or \fIpath=\*(L"~/dl dl$\*(R"\fR
.IP "shell [\-\fIflags\fR] \fIcommand\fR" 2

string, possibly with other letters in between.  The filter is applied as
you type.  When only one directory is left, it is entered and the console
is automatically reopened, allowing for fast travel.
To close the console, press \s-1ESC\s0 or execute a file.
.Sp
This command is based on the \fIscout\fR command and supports all of its options.
.IP "tunmap [\fIkeys ...\fR]" 2
.IX Item "tunmap [keys ...]"
Removes key mappings of the taskview. Works like the \f(CW\*(C`unmap\*(C'\fR command.
.IP "unmap [\fIkeys\fR ...]" 2
.IX Item "unmap [keys ...]"
Removes the given key mappings in the \*(L"browser\*(R" context.  To unmap key bindings
in the console, taskview, or pager use \*(L"cunmap\*(R", \*(L"tunmap\*(R" or \*(L"punmap\*(R".

out the tag argument, all tagged files are unmarked.
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
ranger reads several configuration files which are located in
\&\fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.config/ranger\fR or \fI\f(CI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fI/ranger\fR if \f(CW$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is
defined.  You can use the \-\-copy\-config option to obtain the default
configuration files.  The files contain further documentation.
.PP
\&\fIrc.conf\fR, \fIcommands.py\fR and \fIcolorschemes\fR do not need to be copied fully
as they will only be adding to the default configuration files except if explicitly
overridden. This may lead to some confusing situations, for example when a key is
being bound despite the corresponding line being removed from the user's copy of
the configuration file. This behavior may be disabled with an environment
variable (see also: \fB\s-1ENVIRONMENT\s0\fR). Note: All other configuration files only
read from one source; i.e. default \s-1OR\s0 user, not both.
.PP
When starting ranger with the \fB\-\-clean\fR option, it will not access or create
any of these files.
.SS "\s-1CONFIGURATION\s0"

typing \*(L":\*(R" or in the rc.conf file.  Note that you can define commands in the
same manner within plugins.
.IP "commands_full.py" 10
.IX Item "commands_full.py"
This file is copied by \-\-copy\-config=commands_full and serves as a reference
for custom commands.  It is entirely ignored by ranger.
.IP "rifle.conf" 10
.IX Item "rifle.conf"
This is the configuration file for the built-in file launcher called \*(L"rifle\*(R".
.IP "scope.sh" 10
.IX Item "scope.sh"
This is a script that handles file previews.  When the options
\&\fIuse_preview_script\fR and \fIpreview_files\fR are set, the program specified in
the option \fIpreview_script\fR is run and its output and/or exit code determines
rangers reaction.
.IP "colorschemes/" 10
.IX Item "colorschemes/"
Colorschemes can be placed here.
.IP "plugins/" 10
.IX Item "plugins/"
Plugins can be placed here.
.SS "\s-1STORAGE\s0"

.IP "bookmarks" 10
.IX Item "bookmarks"
This file contains a list of bookmarks.  The syntax is /^(.):(.*)$/. The first
character is the bookmark key and the rest after the colon is the path to the
file.  In ranger, bookmarks can be set by typing m<key>, accessed by typing
\&'<key> and deleted by typing um<key>.
.IP "copy_buffer" 10
.IX Item "copy_buffer"
When running the command :save_copy_buffer, the paths of all currently copied
files are saved in this file.  You can later run :load_copy_buffer to copy the
same files again, pass them to another ranger instance or process them in a
script.
.IP "history" 10
.IX Item "history"
Contains a list of commands that have been previously typed in.
.IP "tagged" 10
.IX Item "tagged"
Contains a list of tagged files. The syntax is /^(.:)?(.*)$/ where the first
letter is the optional name of the tag and the rest after the optional colon is
the path to the file.  In ranger, tags can be set by pressing t and removed
with T.  To assign a named tag, type "<tagname>.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
These environment variables have an effect on ranger:
.IP "\s-1RANGER_LEVEL\s0" 8
.IX Item "RANGER_LEVEL"
ranger sets this environment variable to \*(L"1\*(R" or increments it if it already
exists.  External programs can determine whether they were spawned from ranger
by checking for this variable.
.IP "\s-1RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC\s0" 8
.IX Item "RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC"
If this variable is set to \s-1FALSE,\s0 ranger will not load the default rc.conf.
This can save time if you copied the whole rc.conf to ~/.config/ranger/ and
don't need the default one at all.
.IP "\s-1EDITOR\s0" 8
.IX Item "EDITOR"
Defines the editor to be used for the \*(L"E\*(R" key.  Defaults to \*(L"nano\*(R".

Specifies the directory for configuration files. Defaults to \fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.config\fR.
.IP "\s-1PYTHONOPTIMIZE\s0" 8
.IX Item "PYTHONOPTIMIZE"
This variable determines the optimize level of python.
.Sp
Using PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1 (like python \-O) will make python discard assertion
statements.  You will gain efficiency at the cost of losing some debug info.
.Sp
Using PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2 (like python \-OO) will additionally discard any
docstrings.  Using this will disable the <F1> key on commands.
.IP "W3MIMGDISPLAY_PATH" 8
.IX Item "W3MIMGDISPLAY_PATH"
By changing this variable, you can change the path of the executable file for
image previews.  By default, it is set to \fI/usr/lib/w3m/w3mimgdisplay\fR.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
There are various examples on how to extend ranger with plugins or combine
