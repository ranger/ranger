=head1 NAME

ranger - visual file manager




=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ranger> [I<options>] [I<path/filename>]




=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ranger is a file manager with an ncurses front-end written in Python.

It is designed to give you a broader overview of the file system by displaying
previews and backviews, dividing the screen into several columns.  The
key bindings are similar to those of other console programs like B<vim>,
B<mutt> or B<ncmpcpp> so the usage will be intuitive and efficient.




=head1 OPTIONS

=over 14

=item B<--verison>

Print the version and exit.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print a list of options and exit.

=item B<-d>, B<--debug>

Activate the debug mode: Whenever an error occurs, ranger will exit and print a
full traceback.  The default behavior is to merely print the name of the
exception in the statusbar/log and try to keep running.

=item B<-c>, B<--clean>

Activate the clean mode:  Ranger will not access or create any configuration
files nor will it leave any traces on your system.  This is useful when your
configuration is broken, when you want to avoid clutter, etc.

=item B<--choosefile>=I<targetfile>

Allows you to pick a file with ranger.  This changes the behavior so that when
you open a file, ranger will exit and write the name of that file into
I<targetfile>.

=item B<--choosedir>=I<targetfile>

Allows you to pick a directory with ranger.  When you exit ranger, it will
write the last visited directory into I<targetfile>.

=item B<--copy-config>=I<file>

Create copies of the default configuration files in your local configuration
directory.  Existing ones will not be overwritten.  Possible values: I<all>,
I<apps>, I<commands>, I<keys>, I<options>, I<scope>.

=item B<--list-unused-keys>

List common keys which are not bound to any action in the "browser" context.
This list is not complete, you can bind any key that is supported by curses:
use the key code returned by C<getch()>.

=item B<--fail-unless-c>d

Return the exit code 1 if ranger is used to run a file instead of used for file
browsing. (For example, "ranger --fail-unless-cd test.txt" returns 1.)

=item B<-m> I<n>, B<--mode>=I<n>

When a filename is supplied, run it in mode I<n>.  This has no effect unless
the execution of this file type is explicitly handled in the configuration.

=item B<-f> I<flags>, B<--flags>=I<flags>

When a filename is supplied, run it with the given I<flags> to modify
behavior.  The execution of this file type is explicitly handled in the
configuration.

=back




=head1 CONCEPTS

=head2 TAGS

Tags are single characters which are displayed left of a filename.  You can use
tags however you want.  Press "t" to toggle tags and "T" to remove any tags of
the selection. The default tag is an Asterisk ("*"), but you can use any tag by
typing I<"<tagnameE<gt>>.

=head2 PREVIEWS

By default, only text files are previewed, but you can enable external preview
scripts by creating F<~/.config/ranger/scope.sh> (see preview_script option.)
This script will then be executed each time you attempt to preview a file.

Fetch the default scope.sh (from F<ranger/data/scope.sh>) by running
C<ranger --copy-config=scope>

This default script contains more documentation and calls to the programs
I<lynx> and I<elinks> for html, I<highlight> for text/code, I<img2txt> for
images, I<atool> for archives, I<pdftotext> for PDFs and I<mediainfo> for video
and audio
files.

Install these programs (just the ones you need) and scope.sh will automatically
use them.  Make sure to also have the options "use_preview_script" and
"preview_files" turned on.

=head2 SELECTION

The I<selection> is defined as "All marked files IF THERE ARE ANY, otherwise
the current file."  Be aware of this when using the :delete command, which
deletes all files in the selection.

You can mark files by pressing <Space>, v, etc.  A yellow B<Mrk> symbol at the
bottom right indicates that there are marked files in this directory.

=head2 MACROS

Macros can be used in commands to abbreviate things.

 %f   the highlighted file
 %d   the path of the current directory
 %s   the selected files in the current directory.
 %t   all tagged files in the current directory
 %c   the full paths of the currently copied/cut files

The macros %f, %d and %s also have upper case variants, %F, %D and %S,
which refer to the next tab.  To refer to specific tabs, add a number in
between.  (%7s = selection of the seventh tab.)

%c is the only macro which ranges out of the current directory. So you may
"abuse" the copying function for other purposes, like diffing two files which
are in different directories:

 Yank the file A (type yy), move to the file B, then type
 @diff %c %f

Macros for file paths are generally shell-escaped so they can be used in the
:shell command.

=head2 BOOKMARKS

Type B<m<keyE<gt>> to bookmark the current directory. You can re-enter this
directory by typing B<`<keyE<gt>>. <key> can be any letter or digit.  Unlike vim,
both lowercase and uppercase bookmarks are persistent.

Each time you jump to a bookmark, the special bookmark at key ` will be set
to the last directory. So typing "``" gets you back to where you were before.

Bookmarks are selectable when tabbing in the :cd command.

Note: The bookmarks ' (Apostrophe) and ` (Backtick) are the same.

=head2 FLAGS

Flags give you a way to modify the behaviour of the spawned process.  They are
used in the commands :open_with (key "r") and :shell (key "!").

 s   Silent mode.  Output will be discarded.
 d   Detach the process.  (Run in background)
 p   Redirect output to the pager
 w   Wait for an Enter-press when the process is done
 c   Run the current file only, instead of the selection

By default, all the flags are off unless specified otherwise in the F<apps.py>
configuration file.  You can specify as many flags as you want.  An uppercase
flag negates the effect: "ddcccDs" is equivalent to "cs".

Examples: C<:open_with p> will pipe the output of that process into
the pager.  C<:shell -w df> will run "df" and wait for you to press Enter before
switching back to ranger.

=head2 MODES

By specifying a mode (a positive integer), you can tell ranger what to do with
a file when running it. You can specify which mode to use by typing <mode>l or
<mode><Enter> or :open_with <mode>.  The default mode is 0.

Examples: C<l> (mode zero) to list the contents of an archive, C<1l> (mode one)
to extract an archive.  See the F<apps.py> configuration file for all programs
and modes.




=head1 KEY BINDINGS

Many key bindings take an additional numeric argument.  Type I<5j> to move
down 5 lines, I<2l> to open a file in mode 2, I<10<SpaceE<gt>> to mark 10 files
or I<3?> to read the third chapter of the documentation.

Key bindings can be changed.  Detailed instructions for this are in the
key binding configuration file at F<ranger/defaults/keys.py>. You can copy it
to your local configuration directory with the --copy-config option.

=head1 SETTINGS

This section lists all built-in settings of ranger.  The valid types for the
value are in [brackets].  The hotkey to toggle the setting is in <brokets>, if
a hotkey exists.

Settings can be changed in the file F<~/.config/ranger/options.py> or on the
fly with the command B<:set option value>.  Examples:
 :set column_ratios (1,2,3)
 :set show_hidden=True

=over

=item autosave_bookmarks [bool]

Save bookmarks (used with mX and `X) instantly?  This helps to synchronize
bookmarks between multiple ranger instances but leads to *slight* performance
loss.  When false, bookmarks are saved when ranger is exited.

=item collapse_preview [bool] <zc>

When no preview is visible, should the last column be squeezed to make use of
the whitespace?

=item colorscheme_overlay [function, None]

An overlay function for colorschemes.  See the default options.py for an
explanation and an example.

=item colorscheme [string]

Which colorscheme to use?  These colorschemes are available by default:
B<default>, B<default88>, B<texas>, B<jungle>, B<snow>. Snow is monochrome,
texas and default88 use 88 colors.

=item column_ratios [tuple, list]

How many columns are there, and what are their relative widths?  For example, a
value of (1, 1, 1) would mean 3 even sized columns. (1, 1, 1, 1, 4) means 5 columns
with the preview column being as large as the other columns combined.

=item dirname_in_tabs [bool]

Display the directory name in tabs?

=item display_size_in_main_column [bool]

Display the file size in the main column?

=item display_size_in_status_bar [bool]

Display the file size in the status bar?

=item display_tags_in_all_columns [bool]

Display tags in all columns?

=item draw_bookmark_borders [bool]

Draw borders around the bookmark window?

=item draw_borders [bool]

Draw borders around columns?

=item flushinput [bool] <zi>

Flush the input after each key hit?  One advantage is that when scrolling down
with "j", ranger stops scrolling instantly when you release the key.  One
disadvantage is that when you type commands blindly, some keys might get lost.

=item hidden_filter [regexp]

A regular expression pattern for files which should be hidden.

=item max_console_history_size [integer, None]

How many console commands should be kept in history?

=item max_history_size [integer, None]

How many directory changes should be kept in history?

=item mouse_enabled [bool] <zm>

Enable mouse input?

=item padding_right [bool]

When collapse_preview is on and there is no preview, should there remain a
little padding on the right?  This allows you to click into that space to run
the file.

=item preview_directories [bool] <zP>

Preview directories in the preview column?

=item preview_files [bool] <zp>

Preview files in the preview column?

=item preview_script [string, None]

Which script should handle generating previews?  If the file doesn't exist, or
use_preview_script is off, ranger will handle previews itself by just printing
the content.

=item save_console_history [bool]

Should the console history be saved on exit?  If disabled, the console history
is reset when you restart ranger.

=item scroll_offset [integer]

Try to keep this much space between the top/bottom border when scrolling.

=item shorten_title [integer, bool]

Trim the title of the window if it gets long?  The number defines how many
directories are displayed at once, False turns off this feature.

=item show_cursor [bool]

Always show the terminal cursor?

=item show_hidden_bookmarks [bool]

Show dotfiles in the bookmark preview window? (Type ')

=item show_hidden [bool] <zh>, <^H>

Show hidden files?

=item sort_case_insensitive [bool] <zc>

Sort case-insensitively?  If true, "a" will be listed before "B" even though
its ASCII value is higher.

=item sort_directories_first [bool] <zd>

Sort directories first?

=item sort_reverse [bool] <or>

Sort reversed?

=item sort [string] <oa>, <ob>, <oc>, <om>, <on>, <ot>, <os>

Which sorting mechanism should be used?  Choose one of B<atime>, B<basename>,
B<ctime>, B<mtime>, B<natural>, B<type>, B<size>

Note: You can reverse the order by using an uppercase O in the key combination.

=item tilde_in_titlebar [bool]

Abbreviate $HOME with ~ in the title bar (first line) of ranger?

=item unicode_ellipsis [bool]

Use a unicode "..." character instead of "~" to mark cut-off filenames?

=item update_title [bool]

Set a window title?

=item use_preview_script [bool] <zv>

Use the preview script defined in the setting I<preview_script>?

=item xterm_alt_key [bool]

Enable this if key combinations with the Alt Key don't work for you.
(Especially on xterm)

=back


=head1 COMMANDS

You can enter the commands in the console which is opened by pressing ":".
Press <F1> to view help about the currently typed in command.

=over 2

=item bulkrename

This command opens a list of selected files in an external editor.  After you
edit and save the file, it will generate a shell script which does bulk
renaming according to the changes you did in the file.

This shell script is opened in an editor for you to review.  After you close
it, it will be executed.

=item cd [I<directory>]

The cd command changes the directory.  The command C<:cd -> is equivalent to
typing ``.

=item chmod I<octal_number>

Sets the permissions of the selection to the octal number.

The octal number is between 000 and 777. The digits specify the permissions for
the user, the group and others.  A 1 permits execution, a 2 permits writing, a
4 permits reading.  Add those numbers to combine them. So a 7 permits
everything.

Key bindings in the form of [-+]<who><what> and =<octal> also exist.  For
example, B<+ar> allows reading for everyone, -ow forbids others to write and
=777 allows everything.

See also: man 1 chmod

=item delete [I<confirmation>]

Destroy all files in the selection with a roundhouse kick.  Ranger will ask for
a confirmation if you attempt to delete multiple (marked) files or non-empty
directories.

When asking for confirmation, this command will only proceed if the last given
word starts with a `y'.

=item edit [I<filename>]

Edit the current file or the file in the argument.

=item eval I<python_code>

Evaluates the python code.  `fm' is a reference to the FM instance.  To display
text, use the function `p'.

Examples:
 :eval fm
 :eval len(fm.env.directories)
 :eval p("Hello World!")

=item filter [I<string>]

Displays only the files which contain the I<string> in their basename.

=item find I<pattern>

Search files in the current directory that match the given (case-insensitive)
regular expression pattern as you type.  Once there is an unambiguous result,
it will be run immediately. (Or entered, if it's a directory.)

=item grep I<pattern>

Looks for a string in all marked files or directories.

=item load_copy_buffer

Load the copy buffer from F<~/.config/ranger/copy_buffer>.  This can be used to
pass the list of copied files to another ranger instance.

=item mark I<pattern>

Mark all files matching the regular expression pattern.

=item mkdir I<dirname>

Creates a directory with the name I<dirname>.

=item open_with [I<application>] [I<flags>] [I<mode>]

Open the selected files with the given application, unless it is omitted, in
which case the default application is used.  I<flags> are characters out of
"sdpcwSDPCW" and I<mode> is any positive integer. Their meanings are discussed
in their own sections.

=item quit

Like quit!, but closes only this tab if multiple tabs are open.

=item quit!

Quit ranger.  The current directory will be bookmarked as ' so you can re-enter
it by typing `` or '' the next time you start ranger.

=item rename I<newname>

Rename the current file.  If a file with that name already exists, the renaming
will fail.  Also try the key binding A for appending something to a file name.

=item save_copy_buffer

Save the copy buffer from I<~/.config/ranger/copy_buffer>.  This can be used to
pass the list of copied files to another ranger instance.

=item search I<pattern>

Search files in the current directory that match the given (case insensitive)
regular expression pattern.

=item search_inc I<pattern>

Search files in the current directory that match the given (case insensitive)
regular expression pattern.  This command gets you to matching files as you
type.

=item set I<option>=I<value>

Assigns a new value to an option.  Valid options are listed in the settings
section.  Use tab completion to get the current value of an option, though this
doesn't work for functions and regular expressions. Valid values are:

 None           None
 bool           True or False
 integer        0 or 1 or -1 or 2 etc.
 list           [1, 2, 3]
 tuple          1, 2, 3 or (1, 2, 3)
 function       lambda <arguments>: <expression>
 regexp         regexp('<pattern>')
 string         Anything

=item shell [-I<flags>] I<command>

Run a shell command.  I<flags> are discussed in their own section.

=item terminal

Spawns the I<x-terminal-emulator> starting in the current directory.

=item touch I<filename>

Creates an empty file with the name I<filename>, unless it already exists.

=item unmark I<pattern>

Unmark all files matching a regular expression pattern.

=back




=head1 FILES

ranger reads several configuration files which are located in
F<$HOME/.config/ranger> or F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ranger> if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is
defined.  The configuration is done mostly in python.  When removing a
configuration file, remove its compiled version too.  (Python automatically
compiles modules.  Since python3 they are saved in the __pycache__ directory,
earlier versions store them with the .pyc extension in the same directory.)

Use the --copy-config option to obtain the default configuration files.  They
include further documentation and it's too much to put here.

You don't need to copy the whole file though, most configuration files are
overlaid on top of the defaults (F<options.py>, F<command.py>, F<keys.py>) or
can be sub-classed (F<apps.py>, F<colorschemes>).

When starting ranger with the B<--clean> option, it will not access or create
any of these files.

=head2 CONFIGURATION

=over 10

=item apps.py

Controls which applications are used to open files.

=item commands.py

Defines commands which can be used by typing ":".

=item keys.py

Defines key bindings.

=item options.py

Sets a handful of basic options.

=item scope.sh

This is a script that handles file previews.  When the options
I<use_preview_script> and I<preview_files> or, respectively,
I<preview_directories> are set, the program specified in the option
I<preview_script> is run and its output and/or exit code determines rangers
reaction.

=item colorschemes/

Colorschemes can be placed here.

=back

=head2 STORAGE

=over 10

=item bookmarks

This file contains a list of bookmarks.  The syntax is /^(.):(.*)$/. The first
character is the bookmark key and the rest after the colon is the path to the
file.  In ranger, bookmarks can be set by typing m<key>, accessed by typing
'<key> and deleted by typing um<key>.

=item copy_buffer

When running the command :save_copy_buffer, the paths of all currently copied
files are saved in this file.  You can later run :load_copy_buffer to copy the
same files again, pass them to another ranger instance or process them in a
script.

=item history

Contains a list of commands that have been previously typed in.

=item tagged

Contains a list of tagged files. The syntax is /^(.:)?(.*)$/ where the first
letter is the optional name of the tag and the rest after the optional colon is
the path to the file.  In ranger, tags can be set by pressing t and removed
with T.  To assign a named tag, type "<tagname>.

=back




=head1 ENVIRONMENT

These environment variables have an effect on ranger:

=over 8

=item EDITOR

Defines the editor to be used for the "E" key.  Defaults to the first installed
program out of "vim", "emacs" and "nano".

=item SHELL

Defines the shell that ranger is going to use with the :shell command and
the "S" key.  Defaults to "bash".

=item XDG_CONFIG_HOME

Specifies the directory for configuration files. Defaults to F<$HOME/.config>.

=item PYTHONOPTIMIZE

This variable determines the optimize level of python.

Using PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1 (like python -O) will make python discard assertion
statements.  You will gain efficiency at the cost of losing some debug info.

Using PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2 (like python -OO) will additionally discard any
docstrings.  Using this will disable the <F1> key on commands.

=back




=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 VIM: File Chooser

This is a vim function which allows you to use ranger to select a file for
opening in your current vim session.

 fun! RangerChooser()
   silent !ranger --choosefile=/tmp/chosenfile `[ -z '%' ] && echo -n . || dirname %`
   if filereadable('/tmp/chosenfile')
     exec 'edit ' . system('cat /tmp/chosenfile')
     call system('rm /tmp/chosenfile')
   endif
   redraw!
 endfun
 map ,r :call RangerChooser()<CR>

=head2 Bash: cd to last path after exit

This is a bash function (for F<~/.bashrc>) to change the directory to the last
visited one after ranger quits.  You can always type C<cd -> to go back to the
original one.

 function ranger-cd {
   tempfile='/tmp/chosendir'
   /usr/bin/ranger --choosedir="$tempfile" "${@:-$(pwd)}"
   test -f "$tempfile" &&
   if [ "$(cat -- "$tempfile")" != "$(echo -n `pwd`)" ]; then
     cd -- "$(cat "$tempfile")"
     rm -f -- "$tempfile"
   fi
 }

 # This binds Ctrl-O to ranger-cd:
 bind '"\C-o":"ranger-cd\C-m"'
