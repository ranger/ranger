.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBrifle\fR [\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-f\fR \fIFLAGS\fR] [\fB\-l\fR] [\fB\-p\fR \fIKEYWORD\fR]
[\fB\-w\fR \fIPROGRAM\fR] [\fB\-c\fR \fICONFIG_FILE\fR] \fIfiles\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
rifle is a powerful file executor that allows for complex file type checking,
written to meet the needs of the file manager \fIranger\fR.  rifle's strength lies
in automatically determining file types, depending on which programs are
installed on the system, even without any user interaction.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIFLAGS\fR" 14
.IX Item "-f FLAGS"
Specify flags for opening the files.  Flags are letters that changes how the
program is executed.  Any combination of flags will work.  Writing uppercase
flags will negate the effect of all previously used lowercase flags of the same
letter.
.Sp
Table of all flags:
 f   fork program to background
 r   run program as root, using sudo
 t   run program in a separate terminal, as specified by \f(CW$TERMCMD\fR
.IP \fB\-l\fR 14
.IX Item "-l"
List all possible ways to open the specified files.  Each line will contain information in the format of \fIid:label:flags:command\fR. \fIid\fR is the identification number. \fIlabel\fR is an arbitrary string that was specified for this command, \fIflags\fR are the flags that are used by default, and \fIcommand\fR is the command that is going to be executed.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fIKEYWORD\fR" 14
.IX Item "-p KEYWORD"
Pick a method to open the files.
.Sp
\&\fIKEYWORD\fR is either the ID number listed by \f(CW\*(C`rifle \-l\*(C'\fR or a string that matches a label in the configuration file.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR \fIPROGRAM\fR" 14
.IX Item "-w PROGRAM"
Open the files with the program \fIPROGRAM\fR
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fICONFIG_FILE\fR" 14
.IX Item "-c CONFIG_FILE"
Read configuration from \fICONFIG_FILE\fR, instead of the default.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 14
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print a list of options and exit.
.SH FILES
.IX Header "FILES"
rifle shares configuration files with ranger, though ranger is not required in
order to use rifle. The default configuration file \fIrifle.conf\fR is expected
to be at \fI~/.config/ranger/rifle.conf\fR. However, this can be overridden with
the \fB\-c\fR option. Note that due to the nature of the configuration, rifle will
only read one file, it will not read the defaults in addition.
.PP
This file specifies patterns for determining the commands to open files with.
The syntax is described in the comments of the default \fIrifle.conf\fR that ships
with ranger.  To obtain it, you need to run: \f(CW\*(C`ranger \-\-copy\-config=rifle\*(C'\fR
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
.IP VISUAL 8
.IX Item "VISUAL"
Determines which editor to use for editing files.
.IP EDITOR 8
.IX Item "EDITOR"
Determines which editor to use for editing files if VISUAL is undefined or
empty (in the default \fIrifle.conf\fR). If both are undefined or empty, "vim" is
used instead.
.IP PAGER 8
.IX Item "PAGER"
Determines which pager to use for displaying files (in the default \fIrifle.conf\fR).
.IP TERMCMD 8
.IX Item "TERMCMD"
Determines the terminal emulator command for use with the \fIt\fR flag.  It is required that the value is the path to an executable file which accepts the "\-e COMMAND" argument.
.IP XDG_CONFIG_HOME 8
.IX Item "XDG_CONFIG_HOME"
Specifies the directory for configuration files. Defaults to \fR\f(CI$HOME\fR\fI/.config\fR.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
List all the different methods:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& $ rifle \-l helloworld.py
\& 0:editor::$EDITOR \-\- "$@"
\& 1:pager::$PAGER \-\- "$@"
\& 2:::python \-\- "$1"
.Ve
.PP
Display its content by opening it with "cat":
.PP
.Vb 2
\& $ rifle \-w cat helloworld.py
\& print("Hello World!")
.Ve
.PP
Run it by picking the method 2, which calls 'python \-\- "$1"':
.PP
.Vb 2
\& $ rifle \-p 2 helloworld.py
\& Hello World!
.Ve
.PP
Display the file in a pager inside a new terminal, run as root:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ rifle \-p 1 \-f tr helloworld.py
.Ve
