The files in this directory contain applications or extensions of ranger which
are put here for your inspiration and as references.

In order to use a plugin from this directory, you need to copy it to
~/.config/ranger/plugins/

Note that if you update ranger to a new minor version (for example,
from 1.6.* to 1.7.0), your outdated plugins WILL break and crash ranger.
