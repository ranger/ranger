"""An efficient and minimalistic signaling/hook module.

To use this in a class, subclass SignalDispatcher and call
SignalDispatcher.__init__(self) in the __init__ function.  Now you can bind
functions to a signal name (string) by using signal_bind or remove it with
signal_unbind.  Now whenever signal_emit is called with that signal name,
the bound functions are executed in order of priority.

This module supports weak referencing.  This means that if you bind a function
which is later deleted everywhere except in this binding, Python's garbage
collector will remove it from memory.  Activate it with
signal_bind(..., weak=True).  The handlers for such functions are automatically
deleted when trying to call them (in signal_emit), but if they are never
called, they accumulate and should be manually deleted with
signal_garbage_collect().

>>> def test_function(signal):
...     if 'display' in signal:
...         print(signal.display)
...     else:
...         signal.stop()
>>> def temporary_function():
...     print("A temporary function")

>>> sig = SignalDispatcher()

>>> # Test binding and unbinding
>>> handler1 = sig.signal_bind('test', test_function, priority=2)
>>> handler2 = sig.signal_bind('test', temporary_function, priority=1)
>>> sig.signal_emit('test', display="It works!")
It works!
A temporary function
True
>>> # Note that test_function stops the signal when there's no display keyword
>>> sig.signal_emit('test')
False
>>> sig.signal_unbind(handler1)
>>> sig.signal_emit('test')
A temporary function
True
>>> sig.signal_clear()
>>> sig.signal_emit('test')
True

>>> # Bind temporary_function with a weak reference
>>> handler = sig.signal_bind('test', temporary_function, weak=True)
>>> sig.signal_emit('test')
A temporary function
True
>>> # Delete temporary_function.  Its handler is removed too, since it
>>> # was weakly referenced.
>>> del temporary_function
>>> sig.signal_emit('test')
